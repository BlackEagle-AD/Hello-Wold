# Hello-World
required respository

Greetings and Salutation fellow innovators,

I remember writing the "Hello World" on my first computer the Commadore Vic 20 in basic for my 10th birthday.  After than I had this ambition that my "Hello World!" really should be everywhere.  I'd walk by tech stores and have the 10: print "Hello World!"; 20: Goto 10; on every computer.   When the internet began I wrote the very first web login, back when computers were only used by technically proficient.   Once I saw the internet everywhere, I felt I'd help accomplish something real, and did a decade walk about. 

Now I'm back.
